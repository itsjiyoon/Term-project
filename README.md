1. COMMIT BEFORE PUSH
//push command : git push
If you push without commit + message, we may encounter conflicting issues and it could turn into a big issue 
if the push was not something we discussed beforehand.

2. COMMIT RULES
When you commit your work changes, please follow the rules below
//commit command : git commit -m "your message"
//commit early and commit often rather than finishing your work all at once and push them altogether.

- FIX : bug fix (ex. FIX: Update #24 login button directs to a wrong page)
- FEAT : addition of a new feature (ex. FEAT: Add zoom in feature on #57)
- STYLE : changes that are related to style that does not change the meaning of the code(ex. STYLE: Add semicolon)
- DOCS : changes of documentation (ex. DOCS: Delete #76 game description)

Make sure to start a message with a verb rather than noun form.
# indicates line number

I don't think we need more than these commit messages, but if you have any suggestions, please talk to us in our group chat
so that we can update this file.
